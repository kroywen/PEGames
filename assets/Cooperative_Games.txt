Beanbag Scramble___Open Space___Beanbags, hoops___Class are divided into four even teams and line up in a single file behind their hoop. Four hoops are placed equal distance from a central hoop which contains 20-30 bean bags. On the teachers signal each member of the team, in turn, runs to collect a bean bag from the central hoop to return to their hoop. Only one beanbag can be collected at a time and must be placed into their hoop, not thrown. Once the bean bag has been placed the next in line runs to collect another bean bag from the central hoop. This process continues until all bean bags have been removed from the central hoop, at this point opposition hoops are opening to stealing. No student waiting their turn can protect their own hoop. At the completion of a set time the team with the most beanbags are declared the winners.___Set a bean bag target instead of running for a designated time. For example the first to collect 8 bean bags.
Rapid Nuggets___Open Space___20 - 30 Tennis Balls___Depending on class size the teacher may decide to make smaller groups or have the entire class work as a team. Students assemble inside the designated playing area. When ready the teacher throws all tennis balls from a bucket or box. Students then scramble to keep the tennis balls from coming to rest. If a tennis ball is seen to stop moving the teacher must yell "Dead Nuggets, 1,2,3" and if they are able to complete the entire saying the game ends and the time is recorded.___Have teams compete to see who can keep the nuggets alive the longest
Hot Plate___Any area___Two Basketballs, One Hoop, Four Cones___Divide the class into two even teams. Teams stand facing each other about 4 metres apart. Each team member stands with an arms distance between each other. Teacher numbers each student from the left hand side to the right hand side so that number one in one team is standing opposite the last number in the opposing team. Teacher places a hoop with two basketballs in it between the two teams. Four cones are placed in the four corners of the court area. When a teacher calls out a number, the corresponding two students run to the hoop and dribble a basketball clockwise around their team and place the ball back into the hoop. They then run to the front of the team and the whole team forms a chain and without breaking the chain they all run clockwise around the two cones on their side of the area and back to their original starting positions. One point is scored for the first team to replace the basketball and three points for the first team back in the original starting position. Teacher calls out another number and the game continues.___ 
Human Knots___Any area___Nil___Divide the class into small groups of 5-6 students. Each group of students then form a small circle with shoulders almost touching. Each student then puts out their left hand and takes hold of someone's hand. They then put out their right hand and grab a different persons right hand. The group then work to untangle the knot by exchanging places, following arms, swapping sides or going over/under arms. At no time during the untangling can you let go of a hand___Increase number of students in the knot
Ship Wrecked___Basketball Court___Two gym mats per team, hoops, balls, bats, beanbags etc___Class is divided into teams of about 4-5 students. Each team is given two tumbling mats which form the 'boat'. Teams line up at the baseline of the basketball court and face across to the opposite baseline. The court area in between is designated out of bounds. Each team place their mats side by side on the banks of the river and attempt to cross the river without touching the floor. Teams use their mats to allow them to step from one mat to the next in order to reach the other end. Once they have crossed the teacher places survival rations on the court area such as basketballs, bean bags, cones etc. They then attempt to cross the river without touching the floor, whilst also collecting their rations.___Make it a race or add team mates which need to be rescued along the way
Snake Dodge Ball___Any open area___A soft nerf ball___Class is divided into three equal teams. Teams 1 and 2 form a large circle about 8-10 metres in diameter, while team 3 form a single file holding onto the person in front. This single file is formed in the centre of the circle. The single file is called the snake with the last student in line being the snakes tail. The outside two teams are given a soft nerf ball and attempt to pass the ball around the circle in order to get a clear shot at the snakes tail. The snake must move around, without breaking their line, to avoid a hit on the tail. In order for a hit to be successful it must hit the tail of the snake on the full or off the ground below waist level. Once the tail has been hit, the student breaks off the snake and joins the outside circle while the snake moves around trying to protect the new tail. This process continues until the whole snake has been eliminated or until a set time has elapsed. Team 3 then join the outside circle and Team 1 become the snake. Winning team should be that which lasts the longest as the snake___Use smaller teams or multiple nerf balls
Think Ball___Any open area___Sixteen numbered tennis balls___Teacher divides the class into two even teams with one nominated as the batting side and the other as the fielders. Batting side line up in a single file. Fielders spread out in the fielding area with one fielder standing at each of the four hoops which are setup like baseball bases. In turn each batter comes to bat and then returns to the end of the line. Batters stand at first base and attempt to throw all 16 tennis balls that are in a bucket/box out into the fielding area. All 16 balls are numbered from 1-16 and fielders must return the correct balls to the correct base. Balls 1-4 go to first base, balls 5-8 go to second base, balls 9-12 go to third base and balls 13-16 go to fourth base. Base fielders collect the balls thrown to them from the fielders and place them in their hoops. Once all balls are back in their correct positions the fielding team all yell ""STOP"". While balls are being fielded the batter runs around the rest of the batting team that are lined up in a single file. Each batter scores one run for every successful lap completed, they keep scoring until they hear STOP. Batting team also score 3 runs for every ball that was incorrectly placed inside the wrong hoop. The game continues when batter number 2 comes up to bat while number 1 goes to the end of the line.___Allow or Disallow running with a ball. Modify how the batter scores runs
Who is the Leader___Any open area___None___Class form one large circle. The teacher then nominates one student to leave the circle and look the other way. While the student is looking away the teacher picks a 'leader'. Once the leader has been nominated the whole group start clapping and the student who left the circle returns and stands in the centre. The leader quickly changes the action of the circle by changing what he is doing, to hopping, clicking etc. The rest of the circle must follow the leader as quickly as possible to try and confuse the student in the centre. The student in the centre must try and work out who is the correct leader in no more than about 2 or 3 attempts before a new centre person and leader are picked.___Enforce time limits and challenging movements as leaders
