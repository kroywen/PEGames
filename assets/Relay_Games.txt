Bridge and Stone Relay___Hall or grassed area___Cones___Class are linded up in teams of approx 6 students. Teams line up in single file at one end of the playing area. Cones are used to mark out in front of each team. Each cone should be about 8-10m in front of the previous cone. On the teachers command, the first student in line runs to the first cone and drops to their hands and knees to make a 'bridge'. Once the bridge has formed, the next in line runs out and goes under the bridge on their way to the second cone to make a ""stone"" by curling up into a small ball on the floor. Third student then runs out going under the bridge and jumping over the stone and continues to the third cone where they become a tree. Fourth student runs out under the bridge, over the stone, around the tree and returns back to the group. This continues for each students until the last runner. When the last runner goes around the tree, the tree follows them back, when the tree goes over the stone, the stone follows them back and when the stone goes under the bridge the bridge returns to the end line.___Add extra trees, stones of bridges or other objects
Chain Relay___Any open space___Two cones per team___Class is divided into even groups of about 3 - 5 students. Each group line up in a single file behind a cone marker facing a second cone about 10 - 15 metres in front of them. On the teachers signal the front student in each line runs out and around the cone marker and returns to the rear of the line. Once the front runner joins the rear of the line all team members run holding the waist of the student in front of them, forming a chain, and run as a group out and around the front cone. When the team arrive back in line the new front leader breaks from the line and runs out and around the front cone and joins the team at the rear of the line. Again the whole team form a chain and run out and around the front cone. This process is repeated until the first team completes all individual and team runs. They are declared the winners.___ 
Chest Ball___Any open space___One ball per team___Class are divided into teams of an even number. Each team is then divided into two and half of each team move to opposite end of the playing area, facing the other half from their team. First two students in each team place a ball between their chests and put arms behind their back. The object is for each pair to move sideways down the court to their teammates on the opposite side. This must be accomplished without dropping the ball or without touching the ball with hands. If a ball is dropped or touched then both students must pick up the ball and move to the original starting position. After crossing the playing area successfully the ball is handed to the next pair. The relay is completed when one team has successfully moved the ball using all team members.___ 
Color Band Weave___Hall, grass, hard surface.___Colorbands, four large cones___The class is divided into four even teams. Each team forms a circle in the four corners of the playing area, while a large cone is placed in the centre of the playing area. All students wear a colorband, Students in each corner are numbered around the circle. On the teachers signal the number one runner runs weaving through their circle and when back to their original spot they run out to their centre and place their colorband over the centre cone.  They then run back to their original spot and tag the next runner. The relay is over when the last runner places their colorband over their central cone and runs back to their position in the team circle and sits down.___ 
Jacobs Ladder___Any open space___None___Two even teams line up opposite each other down the centre of the playing area. Each team members stands opposite a member of the opposing team. Each pair sit down with the soles of their feet touching, legs straight and resting with a slight backward lean on the palms of their hands. The teacher moves down the line numbering each pair. When ready the teacher calls a number, eg "3". That particular pair both stand up and run to the front of the line stepping carefully over the extended legs of their team mates. When they reach the front of their line they turn and run along the outside of their team to the rear of the line where they begin to step down the line of legs back to their starting position. When the pair successfully return the teacher can call another number. When the teachers calls "Jacob's Ladder" pair number one goes first, followed by each an every pair in sequential order until all have completed a circuit and returned to the seated position.___ 
Passing vs Shooting___Any open space___Basketball or Netball___Class are divided into two teams, Passers and Runners. The passing team form a circle in the middle of the playing area with one team member in the centre of the circle holding a ball. Running team form a straight line at the side of the playing area. On the teachers signal the passing team start passing the ball around the circle from the centre to outside and back. Each pass caught by the centre person scores one point. The centre player keeps progressive scores. At the same signal the first member of the running team runs out and around the circle made by the passing team and back to the start of the running line, where they tag the next in line. After making the tag all members move up one spot, while the first runner goes to the back of the line. Passers keep scoring as runners run in turn around the circle. When last runner runs back to the head of the line the running team all call out "STOP". The passing team stop passing and call out the total score. The teams then swap roles. The winner is the team with the highest total passing score___ 
Tunnel Dribble Shoot___Basketball court___Basketball, five cones per team, basketball backboard___Class is divided into 4 even teams. Each team line up one end of the playing area facing a netball of basketball goal. Team members are spaced in single file about 1 metre apart with a line of 5 cones out in front of their team. Front student in each team is given a ball. On the teacher's signal all team members jump astride as the front student rolls the ball down the line so that it passes between the legs of every team members until it is stopped by the end student. Students in the line may touch the ball and help it on its way down the line. The last student in each line picks up the ball and dribbles it down the right side of their team, weaves through the cones in front of their team until they can take a shot at goal (one shot only). After their shot the student dribbles the ball back through the cones until they are back at the front of their team. While this is happening each team members has moved bac one position. This sequence is completed until all team members have had a turn and the original leader runs back to the front of the team. Every goal that a team shoots successfully scores two points and the first team finished the relay score an extra 5 points.___ 
Wheel Relay___Any open space___Four balls or battons, cones equal to number of teams___Class is divided into four equal teams. Each team stands in a straight line facing anti-clockwise 90 degrees from each other, forming what looks like the four spokes of a wheel. Number one student from each team places a cone down in front of their team, which forms the hub of the wheel. Number one in each team has a ball and on the teachers signal passes the ball to the back of the line so that each individual member passes the ball in turn to the next in line. When the end student receives the ball they run in an anti-clockwise direction around all other teams carrying the ball and run to the front of their team. While the runner is moving around the circle, the rest of the team move back one place. The ball continues to be passed down the teams until number one receives the ball at the back of their team and completes the run. When number one returns to the front of their team line they hold the ball aloft to signify that they have completed the race.___Add more teams to make up the spokes
