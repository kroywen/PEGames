At all times students must remain inside the playing area.___Make each caboose only able to join a specific line.
Octopus___Any defined open area___Nil___All students line up at the end of the playing area side by side. Teacher nominates one student to act as the OCTOPUS. Teacher calls out "octopus" and the students attempt to get to the opposite side of the playing area.

When remaining runners are lined up on the opposite side of the playing area the teacher again calls out OCTOPUS and all runners again attempt to cross the area. The game continues until all players have been tagged and a new game commences.___Include extra OCTOPUS and limit their movement in the playing area
Round Up___Any defined open area___Colourbands___Divide students into groups of 4. One group are nominated as taggers or riders and are given colour bands. The other three groups are the runners or the "stock". A large circle or square is marked in the middle of playing area, this is known as the 'stockyard' On the signal the riders attempt to tag the runners. Once tagged the runner must go and stand inside the stockyards where they remain until freed by one of the other runners who is yet untagged. Free runners cannot go into the stockyards to make a tag, each tag must be made with an outstretched hand from inside the stockyard. After a predetermined number of time (1-2 minutes) the game stops and the number of stock in the stockyard is counted. The game recommences with a second group nominated as riders wearing colour bands and given the same amount of time to round up as many stock as they can___Change locomotion types. Reduce the amount of groups to two larger groups
Scarecrow Tag___Any defined open area___Colourbands___Depending on the size of the class the teacher nominates taggers. Taggers all put on colour bands and run around the area attempting to tag as many scarecrows as they can in a designated time (1-2minutes). Once tagged, free runners must stand still with feed wide astride and with arms outstretched above their head like scarecrows in a field. Scarecrows can be released by free runners if a runner crawls between their legs from the rear only. Once freed scarecrows become free runners again. Game continues until set time limit is up and teacher blows the whistle. The teacher then counts the number of remaining scarecrows and gives that score to the group of taggers. A new group of taggers then commences a new game.___Have one tagger and change locomotion type every 20 seconds.
Sitting Brandy___Any defined open area___Soft Nerf Ball___Class spread out inside a designated area. One student is nominated as the "brander" and is given a soft nerf ball. Brander must try and hit other students with the ball on the full below shoulder height. Once "branded" students must sit down on the floor. Brander cannot run with the ball. Brander can use the sitting students to move around by passing to them and then moving to a better location to "brand" others. Sitting players may pass the ball amongst themselves but only the brander is allowed to brand others. The student left unbranded is the winner and is the next brander___Nominate more than one brander.
Step Tag___Any defined open area___Colourbands___Teacher nominates three or four students as taggers and they are given colour bands to wear. On signal the taggers run around keeping as close as they can to free runner without tagging. Teacher blows their whistle and the class must freeze position. Taggers on teachers signal are allowed to take one step or one leap to get closer to runners. If a tagger can touch a runner then the tagger and runner exchange colour bands and game continues. If a tagger cannot touch any runner then they remain taggers for the next game. It is advised for the teacher to allow 15-30 seconds of running before blowing the whistle.___Increase the playing size to encourage aerobic fitness gains.
Tail Tag___Any defined open area___Colourbands___All class members are given a colour band which is tucked into the back of their shorts so that approximately 2/3rds of it is hanging loose out the back (like a tail). The game starts with the class spread out over the designated area. On the signal all students aim to run around and protect their own tail whilst attempting to grab as many tails from fellow students as they can. To protect their own tail students should move away or turn away however they are not allowed to hold onto their tails or to hit the arms of the chasers away. If forced out of the playing area while attempting to protect their own tail they lose their tail to the chaser. If a students own tail is stolen they may continue in the game until the game ends. When signal to stop is given all students must count up the number of tails they collected, with the winner being the student who collected the most. Games should last for about 1 minute.___Make the playing area smaller or larger to modify the style of game play necessary to win.
Chaos Tag___Any defined open area___Various small pieces of equipment for easy retrieval___Players are divided into two teams who each start in their own half of the playing area. Players try to cross their opponents baseline, and pick up a small object. They then seek to return to their own baseline, without being tagged by an opponent. If tagged, players stand still like a scarecrow until freed by a teammate. A teammate can be freed by crawling underneath them from back to front. The team who steals the most small equipment within a designated time are the winners.___Increase the number of teams and use all sides of the playing area as the teams baselines.
Chuck the Chicken___A large area___A rubber chicken___Group divided into two even teams (Team A and Team B). Team A starts with the rubber chicken and throws it wherever they like (within defined boundaries), and then one player from Team A runs circles around the rest of the team members, keeping count of how many times they make it around. Team B needs to quickly retrieve the chicken and pass it down the line of their team, going under one person and over the next until it reaches the end of the line. Once the chicken is at the end of the line Team B throws it and one player begins running around their team members, just as Team A did. Team A now collect the chicken and pass it down the line. This continues for the designated amount of time and the team with the highest score is the winner.___ 
Cone Steal___A basketball half court___5 hoops and 15 cones___Two even teams, with one attacking and one defending. Team A starts inside the designated half court area and aims to defend the cones from being taken from inside the hoops. Team B is the attacking team and aims to take the cones from the hoops to outside the half court area without being tagged. If tagged by a defender, the player must run around a designated item (i.e. Bin or basketball pole) before they can rejoin play. If a defending player stands on or inside a hoop then they must run around the designated item, leaving their team one player short for a period of time. Each team has a certain time in each role and the team with the most cones is the winner.___ 
Memory Tag___Any defined open area___None___All players are taggers. If a player is tagged the player must bob down where they were tagged, but remember who it was that tagged them. When the person that tagged them gets tagged, they can stand up and continue the game.  Rock, paper, scissors is a great way to settle any disputes.___
